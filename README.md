# Tools for researching and publishing with collaborators

## GitHub

### Why it is good

  - a tool for tracking, labeling and syncing changes in *line-based* documents
  
  - full control of what and when you sync with collaborators
  
  - minimization and easy handling of conflicts
  
  - no redundant multiplication of versions
  
  - great tools for setting deadlines, raising and solving issues, and distributing tasks

> *Note:* Because GitHub is intended for programmers, it is not always the best way to share things such as large binary data files, word documents and images (although all of this is possible). For files that are unlikely to change, it is sometimes better to store them on Dropbox and then source in the data from R.
